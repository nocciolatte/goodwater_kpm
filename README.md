## Running Instructions
Please run main.py, which assumes today is 2017-01-01 (given data provided). The graphs will show first. Close these to see the dashboard to display the leaderboards.

## Extensions
+ I implemented the algorithms for all extensions except the alternative input pipelines, since those would depend on the format of the xml or json used, and are quite straightforward to implement.

+ I did not implement GUIs for the extensions. The functionalities can be tested by calling the appropriate functions in the class AppData.
